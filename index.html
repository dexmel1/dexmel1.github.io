                <div id="about"><h3 class="lowercase">> About the Developer</h3></div>
                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Dex, a project manager and computer science student <--! with a passion for games, clean architecture, 
                    and turning rough prototypes into polished experiences. For my CS-499 capstone, I chose to take a simple 
                    Python console dungeon crawler and transform it into a modern C# graphical application, focusing on 
                    maintainable design, user experience, and industry-aligned practices. -->
                </p>

                <!-- ARTIFACT OVERVIEW -->
                <div id="artifact"><h3 class="lowercase">> The DungeonExplorer Artifact</h3></div>
                <p>
                    DungeonExplorer began life as a text-based adventure written in Python. The original game let the player 
                    move through a small dungeon map, collect items, and face a final encounter that resulted in either a win 
                    or a loss. All interaction happened through the console using commands like 
                    <code>go north</code> and <code>get key</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the capstone, I selected this artifact because it is small enough to understand quickly, but rich 
                    enough to demonstrate software design, refactoring, and UI transformation. The enhanced version is a C# GUI 
                    application that preserves the core gameplay loop while significantly improving structure, readability, and 
                    player experience.
                </p>

                <!-- ORIGINAL PYTHON -->
                <div id="python"><h3 class="lowercase">> Original Python Console Game</h3></div>
                <p>
                    The original Python implementation used a global state dictionary to represent rooms, items, and player 
                    location. A main game loop repeatedly printed the current room, read the player’s text input, and then 
                    updated state based on a series of conditional checks. While functional, the design had several limitations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heavily procedural with limited separation of concerns</li>
                    <li>Game logic and user interface (console I/O) tightly coupled</li>
                    <li>Difficult to extend with new features or alternate interfaces</li>
                 </ul> 
                 
				
                <!-- C# GUI CONVERSION -->
                <div id="csharp"><h3 class="lowercase">> C# GUI Conversion</h3></div>
                <p>
                    The enhanced DungeonExplorer is implemented in C# with a graphical user interface. Rather than typing 
                    commands, the player interacts with buttons for movement, item interaction, and game actions. The underlying 
                    codebase was restructured to follow a more modern architecture that separates the UI from the game logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The core goals of the conversion were:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Separate game rules from presentation logic</li>
                    <li>Introduce a clear domain model for rooms, items, and the player</li>
                    <li>Leverage the C# ecosystem and tooling (Visual Studio, .NET, etc.)</li>
                </ul>

                

                <!-- CODE REVIEW -->
                <div id="codereview"><h3 class="lowercase">> Artifact Code Review</h3></div>
                <p>
                    In this code review, I walk through the evolution of DungeonExplorer, from the original Python console 
                    version to the refactored C# GUI implementation. I focus on design decisions, trade-offs, and how applying 
                    patterns like MVVM improved testability and maintainability.

                <!-- ENHANCEMENT OVERVIEW -->
                <div id="enhancements"><h3 class="lowercase">> Enhancement Overview</h3></div>
                <p>
                    The primary enhancement focus for DungeonExplorer is <strong>software design and engineering</strong>, 
                    specifically refactoring an academic prototype into a structured application that resembles professional 
                    game architecture. Along the way, I also improved the way game data is represented and explored future 
                    options for persistence.
                </p>

                <!-- SOFTWARE DESIGN & ENGINEERING -->
                <div id="software"><h4 class="lowercase">>> Software Design & Engineering</h4></div>
                <p>
                    The C# version of DungeonExplorer is organized around clear responsibilities and a more maintainable 
                    structure. Key changes include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MVVM-style separation:</strong> A <code>GameViewModel</code> exposes properties such as 
                        <code>CurrentRoom</code>, <code>AvailableMoves</code>, and <code>Inventory</code>, while the view handles 
                        only layout and binding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Domain classes:</strong> Separate classes for <code>Room</code>, <code>Item</code>, and 
                        <code>Player</code> replace loosely defined dictionaries and global variables.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Command-based input:</strong> Movement and item actions are encapsulated as commands, which makes 
                        it easier to wire buttons and potentially add keyboard shortcuts later.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    These changes demonstrate the ability to migrate a prototype into a layered architecture that is easier to 
                    extend and reason about, aligning with industry expectations for software design and engineering.
                </p>

                <!-- ALGORITHMS & DATA STRUCTURES -->
                <div id="algorithms"><h4 class="lowercase">>> Algorithms & Sata Structures</h4></div>
                <p>
                    Although DungeonExplorer is a relatively small game, it still benefits from intentional data structures and 
                    algorithm choices:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The dungeon is modeled as a graph of <code>Room</code> nodes, each with references to adjacent rooms 
                        (north, south, east, west). This makes it straightforward to validate legal moves and visualize the map.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The player’s inventory is stored as a collection (e.g., <code>List&lt;Item&gt;</code>) that drives both 
                        UI binding and win-condition logic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Win/lose conditions are evaluated through a small rule engine that checks both player location and 
                        inventory contents, keeping the game loop simple and deterministic.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In a larger production setting, this same approach could be extended to pathfinding, quest tracking, or more 
                    advanced combat systems.
                </p>

                <!-- DATA PERSISTENCE / DATABASES -->
                <div id="databases"><h4 class="lowercase">>> Data Persistence</h4></div>
                <p>
                    For DungeonExplorer, persistence is intentionally lightweight. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this artifact does not focus on a full relational database, the same architectural choices would make it 
                    straightforward to add features like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saving and loading player progress</li>
                    <li>Tracking high scores across multiple runs</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- FINAL PRODUCT -->
                <div id="final"><h3 class="lowercase">> The Final Build</h3></div>
                <p>
                    The final DungeonExplorer build is a C# GUI application that preserves the spirit of the original Python 
                    console game while showcasing improved structure, user experience, and readiness for future enhancements. 
                    Players can visually explore the dungeon, monitor their inventory at a glance, and clearly see their path to 
                    victory or defeat.
